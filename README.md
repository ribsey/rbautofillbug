# Auto Fill Bugs extension for ReviewBoard

## Overview

This ReviewBoard extension automatically fills the _Bugs_ field of a review request draft with the bug IDs mentioned in the request summary.

## Requirements

This extension requires ReviewBoard 2.0 or higher.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git://github.com/jjst/rbautofillbug
cd rbautofillbug
pip install .
```

Then go to your Administration UI -> Extensions page and click "Check for installed extensions". The extension should show up. If it does not, reload your web server and try again.

## Configuration

You can change the regular expression used to extract bug IDs from the summary by clicking on the "Configure" link for the extension on the extensions list page and changing the value of the "Bug Format" field.
By default, AutoFillBugs will recognise bug IDs of the form _#[numerical_bug_id]_, e.g. _#42_.

It is possible to match on multiple patterns using ORs. For example, this will match "issue 42", "Issue 42" or "#42":

```
[Ii]ssue (\d+)|#(\d+)
```
